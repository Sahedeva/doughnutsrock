## IP (Meet Ivan Pakkitz)

**Internet Protocol**

Ivan is a postal worker who can travel at the speed of light. He's happy to relay thousands of messages per second between you and a friend. However, he can only transport *one message at a time, and it has to fit on an index card*.

Unfortunately Ivan is incredibly inattentive, so there are a few *minor* limitations in his service:

- **Reliability**: He cannot guarantee that *every* message will be delivered successfully.
- **Order**: He cannot guarantee delivered messages will arrive in the same order that they were sent.
- **Integrity**: He cannot guarantee that all messages will arrive in their entirety.
- **Recipient**: He cannot guarantee that messages will always be delivered to the correct recipient.

###Instructions

1. Pick a partner and come up with a set of rules that will fix the issues presented above.

2. Test out your plan without talking to ensure you have the proper rules in place.
