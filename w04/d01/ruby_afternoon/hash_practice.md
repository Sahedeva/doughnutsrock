## Practice with Hashes

**15 min**

Now you try it!

- Partner up! Together and **by hand with markers on the desk**, describe your computer as a hash. Use any data types you can think of, cuz hash values can be anything!
- When you're done, each of you, independently **open your computer, write it out in Pry**. Try getting each key out, adding in new ones, and deleting ones just for fun.
- In your hashes, try to:
  - Include one key with the value as an array 
  - Include one key with the value as another hash (look to the example from earlier!)
- Remember, use the "new way" of creating hashes, if you remember how!
