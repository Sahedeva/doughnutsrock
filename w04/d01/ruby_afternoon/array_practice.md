## Arrays - Independent Practice 

**15 minutes**

Alright, practice time.

- Given the following list of student names, **iterate over them**, **prepending** "A+ " if their name includes an "A" in it. Make a new array if you need to
- Then, **sort the students** so that A+ students come first
- Next, **select just the students with A+** in their names. Look it up in the Ruby docs if you need to.
- Finally, **count how many A+ students you have**

```ruby
students = ['Suzy', 'Daniel', 'James', 'Mary', 'Phillip', 'Siegfried']
```

Methods you'll need: 

``` .map ```, ``` .sort ```, ``` .include? ```, ``` .select ```, ``` .length ```
