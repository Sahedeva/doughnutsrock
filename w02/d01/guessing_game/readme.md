# Guess the number

- Create a basic "guess my number" game.  Set a variable named `randomNumber` to some number you pick.  The user will have a chance to guess the number, and you will tell them how they did.

###Specification:
- The user should be asked to guess a number
- If the user's guess is correct, the user should see a congratulatory message
- If the user's guess is not correct, the user should be told whether their guess was too high or too low.

### Bonus 1
- Make the `randomNumber` variable truly random, by having the computer set it automatically for you every time you play the game.

### Bonus 2
- When the user guesses the number correctly, tell them how many guesses it took them.
