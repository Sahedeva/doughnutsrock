## Technical Interview Questions: Brain Teasers

1. There are one hundred closed lockers in a hallway. A man begins by opening all one
hundred lockers. Next, he closes every second locker. Then he goes to every third
locker and closes it if it is open or opens it if it is closed (e.g., he toggles every third
locker). After his one hundredth pass in the hallway, in which he toggles only locker
number one hundred, how many lockers are open?

## Bonus

1. You have a five quart jug and a three quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water
(but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water?
NOTE: The jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly ‘half’ of the jug would
be impossible.

2. A bunch of men and women are on an island. A genie comes down and gathers everyone together
and places a magical hat on some people’s heads (i.e., at least one person has
a hat). The hat is magical: it can be seen by other people, but not by the wearer of
the hat themself. To remove the hat, those (and only those who have a hat) must dunk
themselves underwater at exactly midnight. If there are n people and c hats, how
long does it take the men to remove the hats? The people cannot tell each other (in any
way) that they have a hat. (We are assuming that every person on the island is an intellegint person who can use the power of deduction to help solve the problem)
