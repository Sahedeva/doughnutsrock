#RESPONSIVE THEMES
There's both good news and bad news. The good news is that we found the perfect responsive theme, the bad news is that with all the money we spent on sweets last week we don't have enough to purchase it.

In today's lab we're going to take an existing responsive theme and attempt to recreate it using our knowledge of HTML and CSS.

##THE DEETS

###PREPARE
- Review your notes on CSS, responsive design, and the grid/CSS frameworks.
 
###REQUIREMENTS
- At a minimum, the design should support a full desktop and mobile screen size. For our purposes today, let's say 640px and below is considered mobile.

###OPTIONAL
- Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap.

###INSTRUCTIONS

**Step One - Study the existing layout and make any adjustments as you see fit**
- This doesn't have to be formally drawn up, use your desk or any of the whiteboards in the room to plan it out

**Step Two - Write the HTML**
- Remember to use semantic markup where you can!
- Link your CSS in an external stylesheet

**Step Three - Write the CSS**
- Remember to include a ``` normalize.css ``` file to create consistency across different browsers
- Remember the `float` and `clear` properties that will help you with your layout
- Add some styles! Make it yours

####BONUS
- Build support for tablet devices as well. Do some research to find out the appropriate screen sizes to consider for this new medium.
